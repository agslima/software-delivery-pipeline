# Phase 4 To-Do (app/)

## Status

- [ ] 1. FHIR mapping layer + read-only endpoints
- [ ] 2. Workflow expansion (refill requests, messaging)
- [ ] 3. Analytics & reporting dashboard + exports
- [ ] 4. Reliability improvements (cache, load tests, scaling)
- [ ] 5. Patient engagement (notifications, accessibility)

## Step 1 Breakdown: FHIR Mapping Layer

- [ ] Define canonical internal models for FHIR mapping
- [ ] Implement mapping utilities (Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, MedicationRequest)
- [ ] Add read-only FHIR endpoints
- [ ] Add contract tests for FHIR responses

## Step 2 Breakdown: Workflow Expansion

- [ ] Refill request data model + API
- [ ] Clinician approval flow
- [ ] Patient messaging (audit logged)

## Step 3 Breakdown: Analytics & Reporting

- [ ] Define KPIs and datasets
- [ ] Create admin/reporting endpoints
- [ ] Export flow with access controls

## Step 4 Breakdown: Reliability Improvements

- [ ] Add cache for read-heavy endpoints
- [ ] Load tests for API/DB
- [ ] Read replica plan and migration guide

## Step 5 Breakdown: Patient Engagement

- [ ] Notification pipeline (email/SMS)
- [ ] Accessibility audit and remediation backlog
- [ ] Patient exports (print/download)
