# ZAP rules (TSV) for ZAP scan scripts (zap-full-scan.py / zap-api-scan.py)
# columns: ruleId  action  threshold  otherInfo
# action: IGNORE / WARN / FAIL
# threshold: OFF / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
#
# Philosophy:
# - Keep "real vulns" (injection, auth, traversal, SSRF, etc.) as-is (they'll be gated by the workflow).
# - Downgrade common "missing header" hygiene findings to WARN to reduce CI churn.
# - IGNORE only when I'm certain it is non-actionable in my environment.

# --- Common header hygiene (usually noisy in CI) ---
10020   WARN    OFF     # Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
10021   WARN    OFF     # X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
10016   WARN    OFF     # Web Browser XSS Protection Header Not Set (legacy/varies)
10038   WARN    OFF     # Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set (SPA often needs tuning)
10035   WARN    OFF     # Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set (often false in local HTTP CI)
10036   WARN    OFF     # Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field
10037   WARN    OFF     # Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field
10015   WARN    OFF     # Incomplete or No Cache-control and Pragma HTTP Header Set
10096   WARN    OFF     # Timestamp Disclosure

# --- Optional: cut noise further (use with caution) ---
# If FE serves only static content on localhost, IGNORE some header checks for FE target.
# Prefer WARN first; change to IGNORE only after confirming it hides nothing important.
# 10038 IGNORE OFF

# --- Keep these as default (do NOT suppress) ---
# Auth/session/JWT findings, injection, SSRF, traversal, deserialization, RCE, command injection, XXE, etc.
# will be gated by the workflow (risk + confidence + patterns/pluginids).
