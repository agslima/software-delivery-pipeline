# ZAP rules (TSV) for ZAP scan scripts (zap-full-scan.py / zap-api-scan.py)
# columns: ruleId  action  threshold  otherInfo
# action: IGNORE / WARN / FAIL
# threshold: OFF / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
#
# Philosophy:
# - Keep "real vulns" (injection, auth, traversal, SSRF, etc.) as-is (they'll be gated by the workflow).
# - Downgrade common "missing header" hygiene findings to WARN to reduce CI churn.
# - IGNORE only when I'm certain it is non-actionable in my environment.

# --- Common header hygiene (usually noisy in CI) ---
10020   WARN    LOW     # Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
10021   WARN    LOW     # X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
10016   WARN    LOW     # Web Browser XSS Protection Header Not Set (legacy)
10038   WARN    LOW     # Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
10015   WARN    LOW     # Incomplete/No Cache-control and Pragma Header Set
10096   WARN    LOW     # Timestamp Disclosure

# In HTTP-only CI this is expected; don’t spam findings.
10035   WARN    OFF     # Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set (local HTTP)

# --- Info leaks (keep visible; often actionable) ---
10036   WARN    LOW     # Server Leaks Version Information via "Server"
10037   WARN    LOW     # Server Leaks Info via "X-Powered-By"

# --- Optional noise reduction (ONLY enable after a few stable runs) ---
# 10038   IGNORE  LOW   # CSP missing
